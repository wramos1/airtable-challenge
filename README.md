# Airtable Challenge

A coding challenge put out by Airtable's hiring process. Was instructed to build a React-Typescript web app utilizing Airtable's API in order to test developer's handling of an external API and its params. All state needed to be managed on Redux along with Typescript typing. 

Table for app can be found on:

A user is presented with an input form in which they can search for a student's information. 

Multiple API calls are then made to search for a student's classes, the classes' info, and then the students' info enrolled in said classes.

Data is presented in a simple UI design to display successfully getting the information.

Log in and log out buttons are integrated to dispatch actions calling state and reseting state as well as to simulate user authentication.
